1. Install most recent version of nodejs
2. Install truffle
3. Install metamask
4. Open a terminal in /exampleApp and type in

truffle develop

This starts a local blockchain for developement and puts you in the truffle environment. Now run

compile
migrate

which compiles the contracts and then puts them on the blockchain.
Keep this terminal open in the truffle environment so it can keep running the blockchain.
    
5. Open a seperate terminal in the exampleApp folder and run

npm run dev

to run the local nodejs server.

6. Open browser and go to localhost:8081, you'll probably get some sort of error.

7. Now click on metamask, click on the network in the top left and choose "Custom RPC".
Set the url to http://127.0.0.1:9545 (the address of the truffle blockchain you are now running)

8. click on "restore from seed phrase" and enter

candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat

then choose a password.

9. Reload the page, you shouldnt get an error this time. It should say that you have some METACoin
under the main title

10. You can try sending METACoin to another address specified by truffle develop to check that it works
